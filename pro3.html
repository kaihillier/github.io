                    <h1>The Phord Promise</h1>Quality, safety, luxury, style, utility, innovation. That is just a small part of the Phord Promise. Every part of the cars we sell is manufactured and assembled with care right here in the U.S.A. The attention to detail that goes into every aspect of design and assembly is what sets Phord apart. The focus that goes towards the safety of every Phord customer is what sets Phord apart. The promise of excellence is what sets Phord apart. The quality of our parts is what sets Phord apart. This is The Phord Promise.

                    <h1>A History of Excellence</h1>Since 1928, Phord Motors has been designing and manufacturing award winning cars for the American people. From Freddy Phord’s first concept car in 1927 to our new 2025 models, Phord has grown into America’s trusted car brand. While we have come a long way and gone through considerable change throughout the years, one thing remains true: Phord is the brand for everyone. From the everyday hero working towards the American dream to CEOs and millionaires, Phord is the brand for you.
